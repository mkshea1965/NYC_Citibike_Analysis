## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to explore a bike share program for the city of Des Moines, Iowa. Using Tableau, we were able to visualize data from CitiBike usage records to prepare a case for an angel investor.
## Results
### Check-out Times for Users

According to the data, the most populat check-out times is during the 5th hour of the day, or 5 am. The graph steeply climbs between hr 2 and hr 5 and gently tapers between hours 6 through 23. If the datum is set to 12 am, it suggests that the ridership is most popular in the early morning. This is counter-intuitive, since the sun isn't up during the most popular ridership time.

### Check-out Times by Gender

According to this graph, there is high ridership among males relative to females or unknown genders.

According to the map, heavy ridership is in Manhattan. It looks as if the top starting locations are close to major transportation hubs such as Grand Central Station, Penn Station, PATH

## Summary
Overall, the success of a bikeshare program may be a nice addition to Des Moines. New York's citibike utilization seems to be driven by those traveling to and from work. If there is a commutuing culture in Des Moines that doesn't believe another form of transportation may be more convenient, then it could be a good idea. Two more visualizations that could provide more insight include economic status of riders and age of male riders. Analyses on the political, economic, working climate should be run for Des Moines.
